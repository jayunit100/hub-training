# SSH into the cluster, and create a hub

1) kubectl create -f pods.env
2) kubectl create -f pre.yml
3) kubectl create -f post.yml

# minishift: create a hub and watch it die 

minishift start

Re run the steps above.

- run `kubectl get events` : do you see any scheduler errors? 
- for pods that are pending, run kubectl describe pod ... ; do you see any failed conditions errors?
- for the pods that are pending, go into the deployments, and change resource needs, see if you can get it to start.

# Advanced 

- Try a hot upgrade  `kubectl set image deployment/... hub-webapp=hub-webapp:4.3.0`
